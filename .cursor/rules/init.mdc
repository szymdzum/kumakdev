# Your rule content

Rule: Always work in small, incremental steps. After completing each step, validate the result by explicitly confirming whether it aligns with the intended goal. At every stage, ask: “Is this what we are trying to achieve?” This ensures continuous alignment and reduces the risk of compounding errors.

Always use semantic HTML. Use vanilla CSS. 
Always create Astro components.
