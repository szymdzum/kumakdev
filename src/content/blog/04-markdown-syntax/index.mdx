## Headings

To create headings, use hash symbols (#) followed by a space. The number of hash symbols indicates the heading level.

> **Note:** Use `h2` tags instead of `h1` tags in the post. Too many `h1` tags on a single page can impact SEO. The post title serves as the `h1`.

```md
# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

#### Heading 4

##### Heading 5

###### Heading 6
```

<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
<h3>Heading 3</h3>
<h4>Heading 4</h4>
<h5>Heading 5</h5>
<h6>Heading 6</h6>
